name: review-plan
description: "Iteratively reviews and refines the current plan using sub-agents until convergence. Use this skill whenever the user wants to review, critique, stress-test, or improve a plan — including implementation plans, migration plans, architecture plans, or any structured plan saved to a file."
---

Save the current plan to a md file if not already saved. Then use the Task tool to spawn a sub-agent and instruct it to read the plan file and review it critically. Look for gaps or areas for improvement. Save changes to the plan file and close out the sub-agent. Repeat this up to 5 times or until the plan reaches convergence, spawning a fresh sub-agent for each iteration.

CRITICAL — the absolute last line of your response MUST be this (nothing may follow it), even if you hit errors or stop early: `RESULT: status=[converged|hit_cap|stopped_early] iterations=[N]` — e.g. `RESULT: status=converged iterations=3`
